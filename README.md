# Blogging Pact

This repo is to record our successes and failures in our blogging pact.

We've decided to put $1 into a pot every week.
When someone doesn't blog, the other person gets the pot.
The deadline is 11:59 every Wednesday night.
(Occasionally, we'll extend the deadline by a day or 2 if everyone agrees.)
A pull request must be submitted by the deadline.

We've decided that it's not strictly blogging that we want to encourage.
Any of the following alternatives are acceptable:

* An article, on a blog or elsewhere, minimum 200 words
* A podcast episode, running at least 40 minutes
* A list of at least 10 commits to Open Source projects

There's no restriction on topics.
Personal, technical, and business topics are all fair game.
Whatever the work, it must be published publicly.
We'll keep a list of what we publish here.

## 2020

We had to have a reset during 2020 because Sam's blog lost a bunch of data :(
